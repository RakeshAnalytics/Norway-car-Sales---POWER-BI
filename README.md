# Suggestions for Improvement:
Toyota: Focus on promoting higher-priced models like the RAV4 and C-HR to boost revenue alongside high sales volumes.
Hyundai: Strengthen marketing for the Tucson and add premium features to increase per-unit revenue.
Skoda: Expand premium model offerings and market the Octavia as a flagship to increase both sales and revenue.
Ford: Build on the success of the Fiesta and Focus by introducing new variants or limited editions to sustain momentum.

# Conclusion:
Ford leads in revenue, but BMW and Audi are strong contenders, signaling a competitive premium market. Toyotaâ€™s high sales volume doesn't translate into revenue, indicating an opportunity to focus on higher-value models. Hyundai and Skoda can boost revenue by promoting premium models and entering higher-value segments.
